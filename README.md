# ScrollToAnchor
QV11 Extension to turn QV Objects into anchor links

A small extension that lets you create small clickable text areas that can scroll to a specific object.
Similar to how html anchor objects works.

This lets you create QlikView apps that are vertically very long and have something like "Scroll to Top" links in your app.
If you want invisable anchors, simply create QV text objects with 100% transparency and place them at the point you want to scroll to.

##Properties
Label: The text that will be displayed in the extension.

Scroll to Object: The object you want to scroll once the extension is clicked.
